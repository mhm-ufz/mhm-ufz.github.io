## Join Us for the Upcoming mHM Teaching Workshop

We are pleased to announce an upcoming mHM teaching workshop focusing on the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) and the multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) concept.

This intensive workshop is designed for graduate students, early career researchers, and professionals interested in distributed hydrological modeling. Participants will gain hands-on experience with mHM, including:

- Data preparation  
- Model setup  
- Parameterization  
- Evaluation of water fluxes and states at multiple scales

Participants are encouraged to bring their own datasets and case studies—ideally from their own catchments—to work on during the workshop. Applicants should apply with a clearly formulated and interesting hydrological problem to explore using mHM.

**Limited financial support** is available, particularly for applicants from the Global South, to assist with travel or accommodation expenses.
