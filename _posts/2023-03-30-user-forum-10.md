We are happy to invite you to the **10th** mHM User Forum on

<p align="center">April 5th 2023 at 13:30 CEST</p>

## Talks

We are pleased to announce two talks for this user forum:
- Charlotte Kihm: Set up mHM for two catchment areas, each containing an AquaDiva research plot from scratch.
- Valentin Simon Lüdke: A hydrograph plotting tool for the mhm-tools package.

## Topics

- the mhm-tools package
- recent changes for mHM and the next release
- miscellaneous news

**Casual talking and discussing your mHM related issues.**

We kindly ask to to show news/hacks/how-tos regarding your usage of mHM!
Don't hesitate to speak up, a simple plot or output log is enough to discuss about!

## New to mHM?

This is the perfect place to get in touch with mHM if you want to start working with the model.
We will have a separate space in our Gather-Town where you can get help and further information.

## Gather-Town

The meeting will again take place virtually in Gather-Town.
The link was sent around in the **mhm-users** mailing list.

## Contact

If you are not already in the **mhm-users** mailing list, just contact us with some information about yourself and we will add you and sent an invitation link to the User-Forum:
