We, the mHM community, are proud to release mHM v5.12!

The release can be accessed here:

[mHM v5.12](https://git.ufz.de/mhm/mhm/-/releases/v5.12.0){: .btn .btn--primary }

# Highlights

We have added some new features. The most notable ones are listed below.

## Command line interface

There is now a command line interface. For example

you can now query the version of mhm you are using

```
$ mhm --version
5.12.1
```

or you can access a help:

```
$ mhm --help

The mesoscale hydrological model - mHM

  Usage: mhm [options] <cwd>

Options:
  <cwd>
      Description: The desired working directory (optional).

  --help / -h
      Description: Print this help message.

  --version / -v
      Description: Print the version of the program.

  --nml / -n <path>
      Description: The mHM configuration namelist.
      Default: mhm.nml

  --parameter / -p <path>
      Description: The mHM parameter namelist.
      Default: mhm_parameter.nml

  --mhm_output / -o <path>
      Description: The mHM output namelist.
      Default: mhm_outputs.nml

  --mrm_output / -r <path>
      Description: The mRM output namelist.
      Default: mrm_outputs.nml
```

Notably, the cwd option is very useful if you are working with a lot of different mHM setups. Earlier, you needed to cd into each specific directory and execute mHM. Now, if <path> contains valid mhm namelists, simply type

```
$ mhm <path>
```

to execute mhm for this setup.

## hourly forcings

mHM can now run with hourly meteorological forcings for precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and temperature.
