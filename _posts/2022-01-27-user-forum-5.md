We are happy to invite you to the **5th** mHM User Forum on

<p align="center">February 2nd 2022 at 13:30 CEST</p>

## Topics

**Casual talking and discussing your mHM related issues.**

We kindly ask to to show news/hacks/how-tos regarding your usage of mHM!
Don't hesitate to speak up, a simple plot or output log is enough to discuss about!

## Gather-Town

The meeting will again take place virtually in Gather-Town.
The link was sent around in the **mhm-users** mailing list.

## Contact
