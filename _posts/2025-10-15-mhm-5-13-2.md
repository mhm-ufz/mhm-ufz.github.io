We, the mHM developers, are proud to release mHM v5.13.2!

# Highlights

We have been busy polishing mHM. The most notable updates are summarised below.

## Morphological input via NetCDF

Morphological input data can now be read from NetCDF files. This makes it easier to keep large datasets together with their metadata and aligns the workflow with the other gridded inputs you already manage in NetCDF.

## Faster flood plain processing

Flood plain calculations are now only carried out for `processCase = 1`. This skips unnecessary work for cases 2 and 3 and speeds up scenarios that do not rely on the detailed flood plain routing.

## Smarter configuration handling

The namelists are now represented as derived types, which prepares the code base for future extensions and reduces boilerplate. We also reverted to the parameter defaults used within the HICAM project and refreshed the documented defaults in the `Optimization` namelist so that new setups start from tested configurations.

## Updated wrappers and dependencies

The mHM wrapper now exposes the additional outputs `L1_melt`, `L1_rain`, `L1_snow`, and `L1_Throughfall`, making it easier to analyse the individual components of the water balance. Under the hood, the bundled FORCES library has been updated to v0.7.1, addressing orderpack issues that appeared with very large arrays.

## Python bindings and assets

The Python bindings and their command line interface received another round of refinements, making scripted runs smoother. In parallel, all mHM logo assets are now released under a CC-BY licence so you can reuse them with clear attribution.

## Bug fixes

- MPI builds now include the correct `use` statements when preprocessing is active, keeping the CMake dependency generator happy.
- NetCDF output now stores decreasing y-axis bounds to match the top-down ordering required by the CF conventions.
- mRM always adds runoff for every sink instead of just the last one, ensuring consistent discharge accounting.
